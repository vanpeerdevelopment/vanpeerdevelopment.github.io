excerpt: In Eclipse it is possible to configure how Java source code has to be formatted. When a Java file is open in Eclipse the 
         code can be formatted by <i>clicking right -&gt; Source -&gt; Format</i> or by using the shortcut <i>Ctrl + Shift + F</i>.

		In Eclipse it is possible to configure how Java source code has to be formatted. When a Java file is open in Eclipse the 
		code can be formatted by <i>clicking right -&gt; Source -&gt; Format</i> or by using the shortcut <i>Ctrl + Shift + F</i>.

		An export of my formatter settings can be found <a href="https://gist.github.com/vanpeerdevelopment/8198341">here</a>. 
		My settings are based on the standard Eclipse settings with some small adaptions. The most important changes are listed 
		below. (Window -&gt; Preferences -&gt; Java -&gt; Code Style -&gt; Formatter)
		<ul>
			<li>
				Line Wrapping
				<ul>
					<li>Maximum line width of 100</li>
					<li>Never join already wrapped lines</li>
				</ul>
			</li>
			<li>
				Comments
				<ul>
					<li>Maximum line width of 100</li>
					<li>Never join lines</li>
				</ul>
			</li>
			<li>Enable the Off/On tags</li>
		</ul>
	</p>

	<p>
		The last option is useful when you have a piece of code you don't want to format. By adding the annotation 
		<i>@formatter:off</i> before the code and <i>@formatter:on</i> after the code, formatting will be disabled for the code 
		between these annotations. The next code snippet shows an example of the annotations usage.
