<p>
	The <code>MAVEN_OPTS</code> environment variable can be used to set options that will be used every time the <code>mvn</code> command is executed. To understand how these <code>MAVEN_OPTS</code> are used you can take a look at the <em>mvn.bat</em> file in the bin directory of your maven installation. Maven is written in Java and is executed as shown in the next code snippet, which is an extract from <em>mvn.bat</em>.
	{% gist 8132831 maven-startup.bat %}
	Here you can see that the <code>MAVEN_OPTS</code> are passed to <em>java.exe</em> every time the <code>mvn</code> command is executed. Thus if there are environment variables you have to set each time maven is executed you can add them to <code>MAVEN_OPTS</code> instead of manually inserting them repeatedly when executing maven.

<p>
	Next follow two code snippets that are functionally equivalent. The difference is that in the last snippet you only have to set the environment variable once via <code>MAVEN_OPTS</code>.
