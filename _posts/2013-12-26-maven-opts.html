	<p>
		The MAVEN_OPTS environment variable can be used to set options that will be used every time the <i>mvn</i> command is 
		executed. To understand how these MAVEN_OPTS are used you can take a look at the <i>mvn.bat</i> file in the bin directory of 
		your maven installation. Maven is written in Java and is executed as shown in the next code snippet, which is an extract 
		from <i>mvn.bat</i>.
		{% gist 8132831 maven-startup.bat %}
		Here you can see that the MAVEN_OPTS are passed to java.exe every time the <i>mvn</i> command is executed. Thus if there are 
		environment variables you have to set each time maven is executed you can add them to MAVEN_OPTS instead of manually 
		inserting them repeatedly when executing maven.

		Next follow two code snippets that are functionally equivalent. The difference is that in the last snippet you only have to 
		set the environment variable once via MAVEN_OPTS.
