excerpt: Adding support for a version control system to the Development Environment is crucial. It is very important for project 
         collaboration and it is also very convenient to have a full history of all the work you have been doing. In this post I will 
         describe how I add Git to the development environment described in the development environment setup post.

		<ol>
			<li>Download <a href="http://git-scm.com/downloads">Git</a>.</li>
			<li>
				Add a Git folder under the project root.
				<script src="https://gist.github.com/vanpeerdevelopment/8656672.js"></script>
			</li>
			<li>
				Install Git in the new folder.
				<ul>
					<li>
						No additional icons, no windows explorer integration, don't create a start menu folder. I just want to setup 
						Git for my project development environment.
					</li>
					<li>
						Use git bash only. If wanted you can adapt your path in <i>environment.bat</i> to be able to use git from 
						within the windows command line.
					</li>
					<li>Use openssh only because <a href="https://github.com/">GitHub</a> only provides support for openssh.</li>
					<li>Checkout windows-style, commit unix-style line endings.</li>
				</ul>
			</li>
			<li>
				Set a GIT_HOME environment variable to the location of Git in <i>environment.bat</i> as shown below.
				<script src="https://gist.github.com/vanpeerdevelopment/8656930.js"></script>
			</li>
			<li>
				Create <i>git.bat</i> in the environment folder to open git bash in the eclipse workspace. As shown below the bat file 
				first navigates to the directory where <i>git.bat</i> resides. Next all the environment variables are loaded and the 
				current directory is changed to the eclipse workspace. At last Git bash is opened.
				<script src="https://gist.github.com/vanpeerdevelopment/8656991.js"></script>
			</li>
			<li>Add a shortcut to the shortcuts folder which runs <i>git.bat</i>.</li>
		</ol>
