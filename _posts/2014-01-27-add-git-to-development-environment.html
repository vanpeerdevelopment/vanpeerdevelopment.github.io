	Adding support for a version control system to the <a href="{% post_url 2013-12-27-development-environment-setup %}">Development Environment</a> is crucial. It is very important for project collaboration and it is also very convenient to have a full history of all the work you have been doing. In this post I will describe how I add Git to the development environment described in the <a href="{% post_url 2013-12-27-development-environment-setup %}">development environment setup</a> post.
</p>

<p>
	<ol>
		<li>Download <a href="http://git-scm.com/downloads">Git</a>.</li>
		<li>
			Add a Git folder under the project root.
			<p>{% gist 8656672 development-environment-git.txt %}</p>
		</li>
		<li>
			Install Git in the new folder.
			<ul>
				<li>
					No additional icons, no windows explorer integration, don't create a start menu folder. I just want to setup Git for my project development environment.
				</li>
				<li>
					Use git bash only. If wanted you can adapt your path in <i>environment.bat</i> to be able to use git from within the windows command line.
				</li>
				<li>Use openssh only because <a href="https://github.com/">GitHub</a> only provides support for openssh.</li>
				<li>Checkout windows-style, commit unix-style line endings.</li>
			</ul>
		</li>
		<li>
			Set a <code>GIT_HOME</code> environment variable to the location of Git in <em>environment.bat</em> as shown below.
			<p>{% gist 8656930 environment-git.bat %}</p>
		</li>
		<li>
			Create <em>git.bat</em> in the environment folder to open git bash in the eclipse workspace. As shown below the bat file first navigates to the directory where <em>git.bat</em> resides. Next all the environment variables are loaded and the current directory is changed to the eclipse workspace. At last Git bash is opened.

		</li>
		<li>Add a shortcut to the shortcuts folder which runs <em>git.bat</em>.</li>
	</ol>
