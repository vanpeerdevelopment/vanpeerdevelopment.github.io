excerpt: "The <code>pushd</code> command can be used to change the current directory and save the directory you came from. Every time the <code>pushd</code> command is executed the origin directory will be pushed on top of the stack that saves the history of origin directories. The <code>popd</code> command will pop the the top directory of the stack and navigate back there."

<p>
	The <code>pushd</code> command can be used to change the current directory and save the directory you came from. Every time the <code>pushd</code> command is executed the origin directory will be pushed on top of the stack that saves the history of origin directories. The <code>popd</code> command will pop the the top directory of the stack and navigate back there. The combination of these two commands can be used in a bat file to change the current directory and go back to the directory the bat file was run from.

<p>
	An example will show the usage of <code>pushd</code> and <code>popd</code>.
	{% gist 8114850 push-popd.bat %}
	Suppose <code>pushd-popd.bat "C:\Temp\Example"</code> is run from <em>C:\</em>. On line three the stack will be as in the next image. The first <code>popd</code> will navigate back to <em>C:\Temp\Example</em>; and the second <code>popd</code> will navigate back to the directory the bat file was executed from <em>C:\</em>.
