excerpt: In Maven2 it was possible to set the location of the user settings file with the <i>org.apache.maven.user-settings </i> 
         environment variable. In the same way the location of the global settings file could be set with <i>org.apache.maven.global-
         settings</i> environment variable. With Maven3 this is not possible anymore.

		In Maven2 it was possible to set the location of the user settings file with the <i>org.apache.maven.user-settings </i> 
        environment variable. In the same way the location of the global settings file could be set with 
        <i>org.apache.maven.global-settings</i> environment variable.
        <br/>
        With Maven3 this is not possible anymore. You can change the location by using the <i>-s</i> or <i>-gs</i> options when 
        executing Maven as shown in the code snippet below.
        <script src="https://gist.github.com/vanpeerdevelopment/8133833.js"></script>
	</p>

	<p>
		The disadvantage is that the <i>-s</i> and <i>-gs</i> options can't be added to the 
		<a href="{% post_url 2013-12-26-maven-opts %}">MAVEN_OPTS</a> environment variable. Prior to Maven3 it was possible to 
		define the location of the settings file in the environment variables and add them to MAVEN_OPTS. 
		This way you could redefine the location of the settings files in one central location.
	</p>

	<p>
		I'm used to having a maven installation for each project and put all the settings for the project in the global settings 
		file of the maven installation. The location of the user settings is changed to the location of the global settings via 
		MAVEN_OPTS, so that only one settings file is used. This way all the project settings are confined in the projects directory. Now, without being able to set the location with MAVEN_OPTS, I just have to watch out to not override a setting in the user 
		settings file. Actually I just do not have a user settings file to prevent this problem.
