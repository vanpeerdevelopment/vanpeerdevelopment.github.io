	<p>
		<a href="https://trello.com/">Trello</a> and <a href="http://leankit.com/">Leankit</a> are project collaboration tools which help you 
		manage your projects by keeping track of all the work that has to be done.
	</p>
	<p>
		Both tools offer features to organize tasks into different categories such as to do, doing, done. All tasks can be labeled to indicate 
		the type of the task e.g. story, task, bug.
	</p>
	<p>
		Both tools are very intuitive and have apps for the most common mobile operating systems. Personally I prefer Leankit because it 
		offers the possibility the fully adapt the structure of the board to your projects needs.
