<p>
	For development I prefer using <a href="http://www.eclipse.org/downloads/">Eclipse IDE for Java EE Developers</a>. This	package contains the Jave EE Developer Tools such as the TCP/IP Monitor which can be very useful when developing web applications.
	<br />
	When using the 64 bit version of Eclipse you must make sure that the <code>JAVA_HOME</code> environment variable is set to a 64 bit Java installation, otherwise Eclipse will complain on startup.
