		Setting up maven is pretty easy, it only requires a few simple steps.
		<ol>
			<li>
				Maven is written in Java and thus needs Java to run. Install the verion of Java you would like to use. I use 
				<a href="http://www.oracle.com/technetwork/java/javase/downloads/index.html">Java SE Development Kit</a> because it also 
				includes tools for developing, debugging and monitoring java applications such as Java Mission Control, JVisualVM, JConsole,...
			</li>
			<li>Download the latest <a href="http://maven.apache.org/download.cgi">Maven</a> version and unzip it.</li>
			<li>Set JAVA_HOME environment variable to the location of your Java installation.</li>
			<li>Set M2_HOME environment variable to the location of your Maven installation.</li>
			<li>Add the Maven bin folder to PATH environment variable to be able to run the <i>mvn</i> command from the command line.</li>
		</ol>
	</p>

	<p>
		The following example shows the commands to execute to set the environment variables and adapt the path.
		{% gist 8114123 maven-setup.bat %}
	</p>

	<p>
		To check whether the configuration was successful <i>mvn -v</i> can be executed. When everything is configured correctly Maven and 
		Java version information is printed out.
