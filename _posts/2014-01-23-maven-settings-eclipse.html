	<p>
		The Maven preferences I use in Eclipse are the following. (Window -&gt; Preferences -&gt; Maven)
		<ul>
			<li>
				Allowing Maven to download artifact sources and JavaDoc makes it possible to take a look at the source code of the 
				artifacts you use and is also helpful for debugging.
			</li>
			<li>
				To make sure that the projects are up to date when starting to work in Eclipse I enable Maven to update maven 
				projects on startup and to dowload repository index updates on startup.
			</li>
			<li>
				The option to hide folders of physically nested modules is very useful when using a hierarchical structure. The 
				submodules of a parent module won't be visible under the parent module in Eclipse.
			</li>
			<li>
				As described in the post about the 
				<a href="{% post_url 2013-12-27-development-environment-setup %}">development environment setup</a> 
				the embedded Maven installation is disabled and the Maven installation of the development environment is used. As a 
				result the global settings file of the development environment is used in which the local repository location is 
				configured.
			</li>
			<li>
				The option to open the XML page in the POM editor by default is enabled because I prefer to edit the XML rather than 
				to use the user interface of the Maven plugin.
			</li>
		</ul>
