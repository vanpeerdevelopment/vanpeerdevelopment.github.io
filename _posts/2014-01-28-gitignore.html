		You typically only want to check in the files that are really neccessary but not the ones which can be generated. By adding 
		files and folders to a <i>.gitignore</i> file they will not be checked in. You can add a <i>.gitignore</i> file to any folder. 
		For a Maven project developed using Eclipse the <i>.gitignore</i> file can be as follows.
		<script src="https://gist.github.com/vanpeerdevelopment/8675303.js"></script>
	</p>

	<p>
		Files that were already committed to a repository but have to be ignored will not automatically be removed. This can be done 
		with the following command.
		<script src="https://gist.github.com/vanpeerdevelopment/8675377.js"></script>
