<p>
	You typically only want to check in the files that are really neccessary but not the ones which can be generated. By adding files and folders to a <em>.gitignore</em> file they will not be checked in. You can add a <em>.gitignore</em> file to any folder. For a Maven project developed using Eclipse the <em>.gitignore</em> file can be as follows.
	{% gist 8675303 gitignore-maven-eclipse.sh %}
</p>

<p>
	Files that were already committed to a repository but have to be ignored will not automatically be removed. This can be done with the following command.
	{% gist 8675377 after-gitignore.sh %}
