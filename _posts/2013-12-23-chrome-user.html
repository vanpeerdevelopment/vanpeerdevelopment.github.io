excerpt: When developing I use Chrome as my main browser. One of the features I like about Chrome is the possibility to sign in with a Chrome 
         user and save all browsing information such as bookmarks and passwords. This certainly is convenient when developing because you use a lot of websites and have to remember many passwords for all the accounts you use e.g. GitHub, email, web servers, jenkins, ...

		When developing I use Chrome as my main browser. One of the features I like about Chrome is the possibility to sign in with a Chrome 
		user and save all browsing information such as bookmarks and passwords. This certainly is convenient when developing because you use a 
		lot of websites and have to remember many passwords for all the accounts you use e.g. GitHub, email, web servers, jenkins, ...

		I use Chrome to manage the following information:
		<ul>
			<li>Bookmarks</li>
			<li>Passwords</li>
			<li>Browsing history</li>
			<li>Apps</li>
		</ul>
	</p>

	<p>
		Another additional advantage of using a Chrome user is that you can sign in with the user on different devices and you immediately 
		have access to all your saved bookmarks and apps.
