<p>
	When trying to push changes to a remote <a href="https://github.com/">GitHub</a> repository with Git 1.8.5.2 the following error occurred: <em>fatal: could not read Username for 'https://github.com': No such file or directory</em>. After some searching I found a <a href="http://rickgaribay.net/archive/2014/01/14/fatal-could-not-read-username-for-httpsgithub.com-no-such-file.aspx">post</a> about this problem which indicates that this is a bug in version 1.8.5.2. Some solutions were proposed in the post. The simplest solution is to downgrade the Git installation.
