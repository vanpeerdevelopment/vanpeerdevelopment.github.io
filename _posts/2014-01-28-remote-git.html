	<p>
		A remote is a URL to a repository from which you can pull changes and to which you can push changes. After cloning a remote 
		repository to a local folder with the <i>git clone [remote] [local]</i> command a remote is added automatically for this 
		remote repository location with the default name <i>origin</i>. The push and pull commands use the <i>origin</i> remote as 
		default as shown in the next code snippet.
